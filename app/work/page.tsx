          <p>
            I joined <a href="https://fazz.com/">Fazz</a> as its first machine learning engineer in its newly setup Data Science team to deploy the company's first fraud detection machine learning model on production.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Created bash scripts to automate deployment for data scientists' development code on notebook to production on github so we can move away from editing and praying on Cloud Functions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Migrated batched features from being stored in BigQuery to DynamoDB for the real time ML model API to ingest the features real time for inferencing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Migrated the deployment of ML model within a different team's mobile app to AWS Sagemaker so my team can have more visibility over the performance of the model and iterate on it.
            </li>

            <li>
              Improved the latency of the company's real time credit scoring model deployed on Kubernetes by load testing and code refactoring

            <li>
              Optimized the company's ML model API gateway service to make use of <a href="https://docs.paralleluniverse.co/quasar/">lightweight threads</a>.
